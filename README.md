# Homomorphic Addition using Paillier Cryptosystem

Homomorphics using the Paillier cryptosystem in JavaScript.

## How it Works

1. **paillier.js**: Contains the implementation of the Paillier cryptosystem, including functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.

2. **homomorphic_addition.js**: Performs homomorphic addition by encrypting two plaintexts, adding their ciphertexts homomorphically, and then decrypting the result.

3. **styles.css**: Provides styling for the HTML elements.

4. **index.html**: The HTML file that displays the results on the webpage.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser, and/or put it at your weserver run.

3. The webpage will display the encrypted values of two plaintexts (`a` and `b`), the encrypted sum, and the decrypted sum.
